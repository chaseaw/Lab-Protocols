When calculating nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio **θ** of a target RNA:

Start with measurements of target quantity in identical amounts of purified RNA.

$WC_{obs}=$ measurement of the target RNA in whole cell extract  
$Nuc_{obs}=$ measurement of the target RNA in the nuclear fraction  
$Cyto_{obs}=$ measurement of the target RNA in the cytoplasmic fraction  

$θ_{total}=$ the ratio of nuclear/cytoplasmic RNA from an extraction <br/>
_total amount of extracted nuclear RNA / total amount of extracted cytoplasmic RNA_  

_Note: should account for volumes removed during preparation, need TOTAL amount from all cells_


$Cyto_{obs} = ({ 1 \over {θ+1} })⋅( WC_{obs} )⋅( θ_{total}+1 )$

$Nuc_{obs} = ({ θ \over {θ+1} })⋅( WC_{obs} )⋅( { 1 \over {θ_{total}} }+1 )$
