Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part 1: Cytoplasmic Lysis (20 minutes)**  

**1.** Make 0.5 mL of cytoplasmic lysis buffer per 10 cm dish and chill on ice.

  | Component | Concentration | Quantity | 
  | ---------: | ---------: | :---------- |
  | Lysis Buffer Base | 10X | **50**  µL | 
  | NP-40 | 10 % | **7.5**  µL |
  | protease inhibitor* | 100X | **5**  µL |
  | RNasin* | 40U/µl | **12.5**  µL |  
  | ddH2O || **425**  µL |
  || **Total** | **500** µL |

  _*Protease inhibitor and RNasin are optional depending on what molecules you want to harvest._

**2.** Wash cells twice in PBS.

**3.** Scrape cells into 450 µL of cold 1X cytoplasmic lysis buffer per plate.

**4.** Lyse cells for 5 minutes on ice.

**5.** While cells lyse, prepare 1 mL sucrose cushion buffer per sample and chill on ice.

  | Component | Concentration | Quantity | 
  | ---------: | ---------: | :---------- |
  | Lysis Buffer Base | 10X | **100**  µL | 
  | NP-40 | 10 % | **15**  µL |
  | Sucrose | 1 M | **701**  µL |
  | ddH2O || **184**  µL |
  || **Total** | **1000** µL |

<br/><br/><br/>

**Part 2: Nuclear fractionation with sucrose cushion (40 minutes)** 

**6.** Mix 150 µL of lysate and 100 µL of cushion buffer and set aside on ice. <br/> This is the whole cell extract fraction.

**7.** In a new tube, add 750 µL of cold sucrose cushion buffer. <br/> Carefully layer the remaining 300 µL of lysate on top of the cushion buffer.

**8.** Pellet nuclei at 14,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C.

**9.** While the nuclei pellet, chill 2 mL per plate of 1X PBS + 1 mM EDTA on ice. 

**10.** Remove 1 mL of the supernatant and set aside on ice. <br/> This is the cytoplasmic fraction.

**11.** Wash the nuclear pellet twice in 1 mL of cold 1X PBS + 1 mM EDTA, <br/> pelleting for 3 minutes each time.
  
**12.** Resuspend nuclei in 250 µL of cold 1X RIPA buffer. <br/> Lyse nuclei for 10 minutes on ice. This is the nuclear fraction.

**Part 3: Enzymatic fragmentation of RNA (15 minutes)** 

**13.** Combine 4 µL of RNase I with 96 µL of 1X PBS and set on ice. 

**14.** To each fraction, add 10 µL of diluted RNase enzyme per 250 µL of lysate. <br/> _Note: it is useful to split the cytoplasmic fraction into 4 tubes of 250 µL._

**15.** Incubate digestions at 37 °C for 5 minutes.

**16.** Add 750 µL of Trizol-LS and mix to stop each reaction. <br/> Samples can be processed as normal Trizol samples.
 <br/> _Note: Be sure to account for small RNA lengths during recovery after DNase treatment._
