___
Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1.** On ice, dilute RT product to 68 µl with RNase-free water.<br/>
_Map RT products are low yield and all reagent volumes can be halved._

**2.** Add 8 µl of Reaction Buffer and 4 µl of Enzyme Mix to each sample and pipette mix.<br/>
_Note: RNase H nicks RNA strand, and remaining RNA serves as primers for 2<sup>nd</sup> cDNA strand_
 
**3.** Incubate reaction for 2.5 hours at 16 °C.<br/>
_Note: thermocycler lid should be off or set to < 40 °C._

**4.** Purify cDNA with [SPRI beads](./SPRI-beads.md) at a 1.8X ratio, 2x 80% Ethanol washes, and 50 µL elution.
_Note: If not going straight to End Prep, you may also want to elute in a smaller volume._
